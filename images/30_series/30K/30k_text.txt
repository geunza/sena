MESH INTERCOM¢â, A STEP ABOVE THE REST
One click of a button instantaneously connects to a virtually limitless amount of 30K users within a mile range via mesh-network technology. With a more stable connection the 30K also intelligently searches for intercom connections when they are lost and automatically reconnects once back in range - without affecting the rest of the group.

THE 30K DOES THE MULTITASKING SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO
The additional BLUETOOTH¢ç processor also allows for Audio Multitasking¢â so you can have a conversation via Mesh Intercom¢â while simultaneously operating Bluetooth such as streaming music, taking or making phone calls, or listening to GPS navigation.

CONNECT IN MORE WAYS THAN EVER BEFORE
Connect with virtually limitless 30K Mesh-Network device users in Open Mesh, 16 other riders and unlimited guests in Closed Mesh or even connect via the 3 additional Bluetooth intercom connections with the option to bridge Bluetooth users into the Mesh group.

THE 30K WIFI PACK KEEPS YOU UP TO DATE AND READY TO RIDE
Take Mesh-Networking communication to the next level with the 30K WiFi Pack, which includes our brand new WiFi Docking Station. Once set up through the 30K Utility App, the WiFi Docking Station will automatically or manually (based on your chosen setting) update your 30K with our most recent and top of the line firmware while charging.
