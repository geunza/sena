SHARE YOUR MUSIC, SHARE THE EXPERIENCE

CRYSTAL-CLEAR CONNECTIVITY AND TUNES
Designed specifically for motorcycles, the SMH5 series provides two-way intercom functionality that keeps you connected to your riding companion for conversations and music sharing through the crystal-clear sound from the Bluetooth¢ç stereo headset.

DESIGNED FOR EASY OPERATION
The Jog Dial and large button on the SMH5 make for an intuitive user interface that¡¯s easy to control while riding. Pushing the button lets you cycle through all device functions. With less fuss, you¡¯ll be able to ride safer.

ENTERTAINMENT, INFORMATION, COMMUNICATION
Staying connected while enjoying the ride at the same time is at the top of the list for any rider. Bluetooth 3.0 technology gives you the ability to make hands-free calls and participate in a one-to-one intercom conversation with a riding buddy up to 400 meters (430 yards) away, while delivering GPS directions, and providing the capability to listen to and share music when paired with an MP3 player or smartphone.

OUTSTANDING SOUND QUALITY
The SMH5 delivers crystal-clear natural sound that gets an automatic boost in noisy environments, while Advanced Noise Control¢â technology cuts down on background noise for both incoming and outgoing audio. The Bluetooth music playback control features play, pause, track forward, and track back functions, and each audio source has its own adjustable volume level.

OPTIMIZED OPERATION FOR LIFE, SIMPLE TO LEARN
You get up to eight hours of talk time and seven days of stand-by on a single charge. All registered Sena owners get access to free firmware upgrades, which ensure your SMH5 is always operating with the latest software updates. Meanwhile, integrated voice prompts (available in English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish) help you quickly learn your way around the device.

CROSS-BRAND INTERCOM COMPATIBILITY
Even if your companions don¡¯t have Sena gear, the SMH5 uses the Universal Intercom¢â protocol, which allows your gear to work with their gear, regardless of brand.
