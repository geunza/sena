HELMET COMMUNICATION FOR THE PERFORMANCE-MINDED

MINIMIZE THE FUSS
Low profile, yet rich with high-performance features, the SMH10R lets riders make hands-free phone calls, listen to music, get GPS directions, and have full-duplex intercom conversations with other riders in crystal-clear audio quality through the stereo Bluetooth¢ç headset. Ultra slim and featherlight, it¡¯s a particularly good choice for riders who want to concentrate on their riding technique and minimize fuss factor.

FLEXIBLE, EFFORTLESS CONNECTIVITY
Keep the chitchat going, share a playlist with up to four riding companions, or patch in a phone call that everyone can jump in on. The Bluetooth 3.0-equipped SMH10R does it all with crystal-clear sound quality and proprietary noise-reduction technology at ranges of up to 900 meters (0.5 miles).

ENHANCED USER EXPERIENCE
Audio levels get a boost in noisy environments while Advanced Noise Control¢â technology cuts down on background noise for both incoming and outgoing audio. Bluetooth music playback control features play, pause, track forward, and track back functions, and each audio source has its own adjustable volume level. Easy-to-follow voice prompts will get you started using your SMH10R. And if your pals don¡¯t have Sena Bluetooth¢ç intercom gear, Sena¡¯s Universal Intercom¢â firmware makes the SMH10R compatible with all other Bluetooth¢ç communications systems on the market. Best of all, it¡¯s upgradeable for the life of your headset, which makes pairing and interoperability across brands a non-issue for as long as you own the SMH10R.
