THE ONLY PROVEN COMBINATION OF BLUETOOTH COMMUNICATION & CAMERA RECORDING
Combining Sena's leading Bluetooth communications platform with an integrated 4K camera, the 10C EVO allows for easy rider communication and video recording. The 10C EVO's features include:

A sleek, compact design
A brand-new camera platform, capturing video quality at 4K/30FPS
Video tagging
Smart Audio Mix¢â
Four-way Bluetooth intercom up to 1.6 km (1 mile)
Bluetooth connectivity to take calls, listen to music and hear turn-by-turn GPS directions

SLEEK DESIGN WITH SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE
The 10C EVO's compact, aerodynamic design is optimized for helmets as it hugs close to the outer shell. This results in reduced wind resistance and noise, improving your audio experience. In comparison to other similar camera systems, the design is slender yet the performance excels where it matters, with up to 20 hours of talk time and 1.5 hours of video recording.

RECORDING THE BEST MOMENTS OF YOUR RIDES
Capture video in 4K at 30 frames per second or take photos in still shot, burst, or time-lapse mode. The camera button allows for simple one-touch recording while Voice Prompts keep you updated on the camera's progress. With video tagging, you can save important events from a continuous loop of video recording, instantly creating highlights. As for storage, the 10C EVO accepts MicroSD cards up to 128 GB.

ADD VOICES TO YOUR VIDEO WITH SMART AUDIO MIX¢â
The camera¡¯s integrated communication system mixes audio from the intercom and music from your smartphone into your video, on the fly. Smart Audio Mix¢â allows you to narrate your footage while it¡¯s happening through the intercom and capture the authenticity of the moment, while reducing the need for follow-up audio editing.

STAY CONNECTED AND IN CONTROL WITH TWO SENA MOBILE APPS
Linking up your 10C EVO with the Sena Headset App (for Android or iPhone) allows you to configure communication settings and access an interactive Quick Start Guide. Using the Sena Camera App, users have the ability to preview the footage being shot on their 10C EVO directly on their smartphone via built-in WiFi, and even instantly download files. It also allows you to fine-tune settings such as video recording mode and resolution, video microphone gain, and speaker sound recording.
