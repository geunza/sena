COMPATIBLE WITH THE SHOEI NEOTEC II AND J-CRUISE II
Designed jointly by Sena and SHOEI, the SRL is a communication system tailored for the SHOEI Neotec II, the upgraded version of the wildly popular Neotec helmet. Also compatible with the SHOEI J-Cruise II, the SRL is virtually undetectable from the outside of either helmet. The unit functions like our top-selling 20S, but with a simple 3-button control.

COMMUNICATION IS OUR GAME
A dual Bluetooth chip allows for intercom with up to 7 other riders as well as Audio Multitasking to listen to music and talk to other riders via intercom simultaneously. When audio comes through the intercom music will automatically decrease in volume, and return to a normal volume when riders stop talking over the intercom. Simply pair your SHOEI helmet communication system with your smartphone to stream music, listen to GPS directions, and take and make phone calls.

A FEATURE SET TO KEEP YOU MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION
In addition to the the Universal and Group Intercom features, the SRL offers music sharing and Sena¡¯s Advanced Noise Control technology. Smart volume regulates the volume of your music when the environment outside of your helmet changes, due to wind noise or increased speed. Built in FM radio lets riders easily scan through and save radio stations.

VERSATILE CONNECTIVITY MAKES FOR VERSATILE CAPABILITIES
Linking the SRL, SHOEI communication system with the Sena Smartphone App (for iPhone and Android) allows you to configure device settings and access our quick guide at the click of a button. The SRL can also easily connect to the Sena RideConnected App to intercom with a virtually limitless amount of riders over an infinite range, so long as you are connected to a mobile network.
