THE NEW STANDARD: MESH 2.0
Mesh 2.0 brings a new level of robust, reliable connections and smart, flexible intercom message routing to the 50S thanks to significant technical enhancements made to the original Sena Mesh Intercom¢â algorithm. Sena¡¯s 50S units actively share information between each other within the Mesh 2.0 network at an astounding rate. An ingenious system of prompts and responses between the Mesh 2.0 units has resulted in 80% more data being transferred across challenging and harsh conditions. Furthermore, Mesh 2.0 units quickly determine the ideal pathway to efficiently transmit messages from rider to rider.
The results of the new Mesh 2.0 technology translate into an unprecedented level of intercom audio quality and robust connectivity for all Sena Mesh 2.0 intercom users. Tested and proven in the most demanding situations, Sena¡¯s Mesh 2.0 network keeps the communication lines with your fellow riders clear and stable.

MULTI-CHANNEL COMMUNICATION AND PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS
The 50S delivers not one, but three different intercom modes available to Sena riders: Multi-Channel Open Mesh Intercom¢â, Group Mesh Intercom¢â, and Bluetooth Intercom.
Multi-Channel Open Mesh Intercom (Open Mesh) features the industry¡¯s first Mesh Intercom¢â channel system! Similar to standard handheld or CB radios, the 50S Mesh 2.0 system allows users to switch between nine different channels when operating in Open Mesh mode. Open Mesh offers a simple, single push of a button to click-to-connect to the Mesh 2.0 intercom network. It also supports a near-limitless number of users within a range of up to 5 miles / 8 km (min. 6 riders @ 1.2 mi / 2 km intervals)! With this ease of connecting, huge user capacity, incredible range, AND the inclusion of the nine-channel feature, the 50S Open Mesh Intercom mode is sure to be a game-changer for those large group/club rides.
If you prefer a private group conversation, simply switch to Group Mesh Intercom mode. Group Mesh supports a single, private group for up to 24 participants and the same amazing range as Open Mesh. To ensure privacy, only invited users can join the Group Mesh chat. Whichever of the two Mesh Intercom¢â modes you choose, you¡¯ll enjoy the robust reliability engineered into Sena¡¯s new Mesh 2.0 network.
Finally, and as always, the traditional four-way Bluetooth Intercom mode continues to be an option for connecting other Sena Bluetooth-enabled users within a 1.2-mile range. Additionally, 50S users can pair with a Sena Bluetooth Intercom user and ¡®bridge¡¯ them into a Mesh 2.0 intercom conversation!

TAKE CONTROL ON YOUR RIDE WITH VOICE COMMANDS
There¡¯s no need to lift a finger when you can ask the 50S to handle it. Voice commands give you control of Sena¡¯s 50S system functions, such as answering the phone or starting up a Group Mesh session. The 50S supports these system voice commands across eight languages, including English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, and Russian!
But what if you¡¯re running low on gas? ¡°Hey Google, please give me directions to the nearest gas station.¡± The 50S can connect to Google Assistant and Apple¡¯s Siri with just a simple voice command allowing you to tap into the power of your smartphone¡¯s features, including GPS navigation, music playback, voice dialing, or a myriad of other options. Wondering where the nearest BBQ joint is? Need to find a hotel for the night? Want to listen to your favorite band? Whatever it is, all you need to do is ask: ¡°Hey Siri¡± or ¡°Hey Google¡±! THIS is how to #RIDECONNECTED

RAPID CHARGING AND AUTOMATIC UPDATES: MEET THE SENA WIFI ADAPTER
The 50S features a high-density battery that charges 30% faster in comparison to its predecessors. The headset is fully charged in only an hour, providing up to nine hours of Mesh intercom talk time or 14 hours of Bluetooth intercom talk time. Plus, with Sena¡¯s fast-charging feature, in as little as 20 minutes, the 50S will provide up to 3.5 hours of Mesh communication or 6 hours of Bluetooth intercom!
The included Sena WiFi Adapter handles your rapid charging needs AND can also be programmed to automatically install any available firmware updates to your 50S via your wireless network! Connect the adapter to your WiFi network, and after a one-time setup, it¡¯s programmed to detect and install updates when the headset is connected. It¡¯s never been easier to keep your Sena headset up to date!
